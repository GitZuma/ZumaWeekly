In addition to the new level, we have reset the difficulty of the "adventure" level,
and set four kinds of difficulties for you：easy, normal (the level difficulty in the
compression package defaults to this), difficult, lunatic (not recommended), which
will definitely bring you a different game experience. [the method to change
difficulty: rename the original levels.xml to another name and save it properly,
then rename the corresponding levels (xxx). xml of difficulty, and delete the
whole name of bracket to use]
